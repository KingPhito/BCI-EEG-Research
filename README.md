# BCI-EEG-Research

Assorted notebooks and machine learning models based on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) for the purpose of understanding and developing BCI and EEG applications.

## Running the Notebooks

To run the notebooks locally, you will need to install the required packages. You can do this with [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) by running the following command in the terminal:

```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
```

Replace `<env>` with the name of the environment you want to create.

### Google Colab

You can also run the notebooks in Google Colab. Each notebook will have a link to open it in Colab at the top of the notebook.
